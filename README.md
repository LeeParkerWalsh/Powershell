# Powershell
Powershell bits and bobs
Place to store a few Powershell scripts I've worked on
ram and cpu is for baseline performance measuring of a Windows server after reboot to save sitting and babysitting Performance monitor
logevents is to make grabbing recent events from the Event Viewer a lot less painless, just change up log level, which log etc
AutoService is for just quickly pulling services set to automatic and sort to easily see which ones haven't started.
Can put them all together and it automates all post reboot checks we do as standard for a Windows Server
